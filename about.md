Hello, my name is Daniel Truong. I am a web design and technological aficiando based out of Central New York. I graduated from SUNY Oswego in 2014 with a Bachelors degree in Applied Mathematical Economics (Computer Information Systems as a minor). Currently, I am pursuing a Masters degree at SUNY Polytechnic Institute (formerly SUNYIT) in Information Design and Technology.

When I am not busy, I like to work on programming problems that engage me mentally. I also like to operate barbeque grills for family cookouts in the summer. Amongst peers, I can be found trying to play (and lose horribly at) Mario Kart 8 and Team Fortress 2.
